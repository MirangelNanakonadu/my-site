                <h1>MERCEDES BENZ</h1>
                <h2>PRICE:$168,600</h2>
                    <p>Earlier this year, the all-new and hotly anticipated 2018 Mercedes-AMG E63 S wagon took its official worldly bow at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. 
                    Some few short weeks later, the E63 S wagon arrived officially on U.S. soil for the first time at the 2017 New York International Auto Show. And now, Mercedes-AMG just published the E63 S wagon’s official starting price, which begins at $106,950, excluding the $995 destination and delivery charge.
                    That may sound like a lot of dough for getting the kids to school. But this isn’t just any normal E-Class wagon. 
                    It’s hands down one of the fastest ways to get your youngsters and their things to the next destination, 
                    thanks to the same drive- and powertrain as the Mercedes-AMG E63 S sedan. That of course means an incredible AMG-tuned 4.0-liter biturbo V8, 
                    offering up a total output of 603 horsepower and 627 pound-feet of twist. With a standard nine-speed AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT automatic, 
                    the E63 S can go from a standstill to 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds. Should you find yourself at a racetrack with a long enough stretch of road,
                     the 2018 Mercedes-AMG E63 S wagon can top out at over 180 mph.</p>
