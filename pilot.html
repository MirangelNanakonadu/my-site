               <h1> 2018 Honda Pilot LX, EX, EX-L</h1>
               <h2>PRICE:$35,949</h2>
<p>Five Pilot trims comprise the lineup, starting with the base model LX and moving up to the EX, EX-L, Touring, and Elite trims. The first four trims are available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel-drive. The Elite trim is AWD only. Starting prices range from $30,900 for the Pilot LX with FWD to $47,470 for an AWD Pilot Elite.

Honda’s usual practice of bundling features as you move up the trim levels simplifies decision making. Choose your Pilot based on must-have features or price level and you’re done.

The 2018 Pilot LX, starting price $30,900 with two-wheel drive or $32,800 with AWD, is the base model. The LX has a six-speed automatic transmission, 18-inch wheels, rearview camera with static guidelines, power side mirrors, a 4.2-inch color LCD driver information display, single-zone air conditioning, push-button start, power windows, power door and tailgate locks, and cruise control. The LX’s infotainment system has a 5-inch color LCD screen, Bluetooth support for phone and music streaming, MP3 compatibility, and two 12V power outlets.

Moving up one step from the Pilot LX to EX makes a huge difference. The 2018 EX — starting price $33,330 with two-wheel drive, $35,230 with AWD — adds remote engine start, three-zone automatic climate control, dynamic guidelines with the rearview camera display, Honda LaneWatch, and optional Honda Sensing availability. EXs also include LED daytime running lights, automatic headlights, fog lights, HomeLink universal garage opener, illuminated front vanity mirrors, and a 10-way power adjustable driver seat with lumbar support.

The EX infotainment system adds an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment display, HondaLink, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, SiriusXM Radio, Pandora compatibility, and SMS text message support.

Pilot luxury begins with the EX-L, starting price $36,760 with two-wheel drive and $38,660 with AWD. 
The EX-L adds leather-trimmed seats, one-touch folding second-row seats, heated front seats, a four-way power adjustable passenger seat,
 a power moonroof, power tailgate, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.</p>
